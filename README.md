# Weather-Monitoring-System
This project is a Weather Monitoring System that simulates sensor data for temperature, humidity, and pressure, and visualizes the data in real-time using Python. It is designed to help students and developers understand how to collect, simulate, and visualize environmental data.

Features
*Simulates sensor data for temperature (Â°C), humidity (%), and pressure (hPa).
*Visualizes the data in real-time using Matplotlib.
*Continuously updates graphs as new data points are simulated.
*Supports easy modification to integrate real sensors.

Technologies Used
*Python: Core language for simulation and visualization.
*Matplotlib: For data visualization and real-time graph updates.
*NumPy: For generating random data points and numerical operations.
*Google Colab: Run the project easily in a cloud-based Python environment.
